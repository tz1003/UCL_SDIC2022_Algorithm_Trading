# UCL SDIC2022 Algorithm Trading Project

This project is to design an algorithmic trading system in a dynamically evolving way of tracking the  asset class and market. Besides the traditional pre-trading design and prediction based on Real-time/Historic data, the Post-Trade analysis will include Data Optimisation and Model Optimization components which are the distinguishing features from the traditional trading system. The system will do the Post-Trade Analysis based on the machine learning algorithms implemented. We will design the algorithmic trading system; select and analysis algorithms to implement; choose historical data to simulate a algorithm trading process and write a report based on the performance and practicability.
